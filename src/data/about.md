# Intro

I am a SDE-II at Flipkart Internet Private Limited, a subsidiary of Walmart Inc., and will be joining the University of Massachusetts Amherst as a Master’s student in Computer Science starting September 2025.

# Some History

- I was born and raised in India, a country known for its rich cultural diversity and technological talent. Growing up, I developed a keen interest in mathematics, which inspired me to pursue a career in engineering.
- I began my undergraduate studies at Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee in 2018, majoring in Mechanical Engineering. This laid the foundation for my technical and analytical skills, which I continue to build upon today.
- My first exposure to programming came during my freshman year, where I learned C++. This experience introduced me to structured problem-solving and computational thinking.
- My introduction to AI began during my internship at Spur.fit, where I developed solutions for motion tracking using advanced deep learning techniques. This experience reinforced my interest in AI and its practical applications.
- After graduating, I started my professional journey at Flipkart as a SDE1. Here, I gained hands-on experience working on large-scale distributed systems, optimizing real-time operations, and contributing to impactful solutions for millions of users.
- Soon after two years, I was promoted to SDE2 for designing and implementing critical features and driving measurable team impact. This role gave me the opportunity to own key components, boost system performance, and deliver results under tight timelines.
- In 2025, I decided to pursue a Master’s in Computer Science at The University of Massachusetts, Amherst, to deepen my understanding of core computer science concepts and further enhance my technical expertise.

# Fun Facts

- I write scripts for even the smallest tasks, too lazy to do it manually when the computer can handle it for me.
- I spend more time perfecting my emails than I do writing code
<!-- - I have a love-hate relationship with coding: it powers my work but makes me question my sleep schedule. -->
<!-- - I decided to pursue a Master’s degree because I wanted to understand why my own scripts from professional work sometimes got executed "by chance." -->
- I secretly enjoy debugging more than coding.
<!-- - I’ve learned over five programming languages, but somehow, I still leave the syntax part to GitHub Copilot. -->
<!-- - I can watch any sport, but playing them is where I draw the line. -->
- I use ChatGPT for picking the perfect pineapple at the store.

# I Dream Of

- Staying curious.
- Continually improving.
- Reading as many books as possible
- Fewer software updates on my work laptop.
